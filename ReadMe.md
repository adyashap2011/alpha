# Homeato
With the recent pandemic, lots of people have become victims of unemployment. Local businesses are also facing financial issues to persist in this market. This makes it difficult for a lot of people who were the single earning members to provide their families with food. Hence, we come up with a solution. Our web app, Homeato is connecting poor people with people who might have extra food and allows them to donate. This way we fight food wastage as well as give food to the needy. We also let small businesses come up with their menu card and show the items they are willing to sell, so that they don't face competition with already established restaurants.
